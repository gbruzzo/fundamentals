# AGENTS.md — Fundamentals of Active Inference (Python Companion)

This file guides AI assistants working with the Fundamentals of Active Inference
Python companion repository.

The project is open source and maintained by the
[Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.institute/); ongoing
cohort-based textbook reading groups run at
[textbook-group.activeinference.institute](https://textbook-group.activeinference.institute/).

## Repository Overview

This repo provides a tested Python implementation of the algorithms described in
Sanjeev V. Namjoshi's *Fundamentals of Active Inference* (MIT Press, 2026),
plus thin orchestrator scripts that reproduce the figures and numerical examples
of Chapters 1–10 (Part I §1–5, plus Part II §6–10).

## Architecture

The codebase follows a two-layer architecture:

- **Layer 1 (library):** `src/active_inference/` — reusable, documented, tested
  classes and functions organized into six subpackages: `core`, `estimators`,
  `visualizations`, `utils`, plus the strict-UI peers `menu` (stdlib text
  menu) and `web` (stdlib local web server).
- **Layer 2 (orchestrators):** `chapters/chapter_01/` through
  `chapters/chapter_10/` plus `extras/<topic>/` — thin scripts (≤ ~120
  lines each) that wire library components together to produce figures and
  numerical results.

All business logic lives in `src/`. Scripts orchestrate; they do not contain
domain logic.

| `output/data/` | Generated raw-data NPZ arrays plus JSON metadata/manifests for every saved non-interactive chapter or extras artifact |

## Ground Truth Sources

- **Active chapter list:** Chapters 1–10 are present on disk; each chapter's scripts mirror the manuscript examples and are
  covered by smoke tests.
- **Canonical import surface:** Defined in `src/active_inference/__init__.py`
  and its `__all__` list.
- **Notation mapping:** `docs/notation.md` maps every symbol to its Python
  identifier.
- **Architecture diagram:** `docs/architecture.md` contains the layered design
  and key types table.

## Conventions

- All variances are *variances*, not standard deviations.
- Densities are evaluated on 1-D NumPy grids; integration uses `np.trapezoid`.
- Every chapter and extras script accepts `--save` for headless rendering;
  stochastic scripts also accept `--seed` for reproducibility.
- With `--save`, every non-interactive chapter or extras script must produce
  both the visual artifact and at least one raw-data sidecar. Chapters write
  `output/data/chapter_NN/<stem>.npz` + `<stem>.json`; extras write
  `output/data/extras/<topic>/<stem>.npz` + `<stem>.json`. Use
  `save_chapter_data` / `save_extra_data` directly for bespoke exports or the
  shared visualization save helpers for figure-derived exports.
- Random number generators are passed explicitly via `numpy.random.Generator`
  — no global state.
- Chapter and extras scripts import only from `active_inference` or the Python
  standard library — never from other chapter or extras scripts.
- `MPLBACKEND=Agg` is used in all CI and smoke-test contexts so no display is
  required.

## Testing

```bash
# Full suite (unit tests + chapter smoke tests)
uv run pytest                                # or: pytest

# Unit tests only — skip the slow subprocess smoke tests
uv run pytest tests/core tests/estimators tests/utils tests/visualizations

# Smoke tests (run every chapter script with --save)
uv run pytest tests/chapters -v

# Validate generated raw-data sidecars
uv run python scripts/validate_raw_data_exports.py --root output/data --chapters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

# Validate all generated chapter and extras raw-data sidecars
uv run python scripts/validate_raw_data_exports.py --root output/data

# Coverage
uv run pytest --cov=active_inference --cov-report=term-missing
```

Coverage targets: 90%+ for `src/active_inference/` (excluding thin wrappers
that mainly glue imports).

## How to Add a New Example

1. Add a method or class to the appropriate `src/active_inference/` submodule
   (with corresponding unit tests in `tests/<sub>/`).
2. Create a thin orchestrator in the appropriate `chapters/chapter_<N>/`
   directory or `extras/<topic>/` directory (≤ ~120 lines; imports only from
   `active_inference`).
3. Accept `--save`; add `--seed` whenever the script samples or otherwise
   depends on pseudo-randomness.
4. Document the script in the chapter or extras topic `README.md`.
5. Ensure `--save` writes reconstructable raw data. Prefer plotting through
   `save_or_show` / `save_animation`; if the script has non-plotted arrays,
   call `save_chapter_data(chapter, stem, arrays, metadata, figures=...)` for
   chapter scripts or `save_extra_data(topic, stem, arrays, metadata,
   figures=...)` for extras.
6. The `tests/chapters/test_smoke.py` parametrize globs and the
   `active_inference.menu` discovery both pick the file up automatically
   as long as it follows the `example_*.py` / `animation_*.py` /
   `visualize_*.py` / `0N_*.py` naming convention.
7. `scripts/run_all_figures.py` discovers the same way — no edit needed.

## Environment management

- The recommended workflow is `uv sync` + `uv run` (see
  [`docs/uv.md`](docs/uv.md)). Plain `pip install -e ".[dev]"` is still
  supported.
- `uv.lock` is committed; `.venv/` is git-ignored.
- After changing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and
  commit the regenerated lockfile.
