# chapters/chapter_01/ — The Hypothesis-Testing Brain

Chapter 1 scripts reproduce the core thought experiments from the book's
opening chapter. Each one is a thin orchestrator that imports from
`active_inference` and standard library.

## Scripts

| Script | Lines | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| [`01_box_scenario.py`](01_box_scenario.py) | ~110 | The "agent in a box" thought experiment as a stream of noisy sensor readings |
| [`02_three_perspectives.py`](02_three_perspectives.py) | ~110 | Side-by-side simulation of the *scientific*, *hypothesis-testing*, and *statistical* views |
| [`03_bayes_intuition.py`](03_bayes_intuition.py) | ~110 | Bayes' theorem step-by-step on a single-state, single-observation toy |
| [`04_inverse_problem.py`](04_inverse_problem.py) | ~110 | Non-injective generator → bi-modal posterior |

## Running

```bash
# Run a single script (headless — saves to output/figures/chapter_01/)
python chapters/chapter_01/03_bayes_intuition.py --save

# Run all Chapter 1 scripts at once
python scripts/run_all_figures.py --chapters 1
```

Each script accepts `--save` for headless rendering; stochastic scripts also
accept `--seed` for reproducibility. With no flags, an interactive matplotlib
window opens.

## Library Usage

All four scripts import from the top-level `active_inference` package:

```python
from active_inference import (
    GridBayesianInference,
    gaussian_pdf,
    gaussian_log_pdf,
    make_grid,
    get_logger,
)
```

## Smoke Tests

`tests/chapters/test_smoke.py` runs each script with `--save` via
subprocess and asserts exit code 0 (see test function
`test_chapter_1_scripts_run`). Discovery is glob-driven, so any new
`0N_*.py` file in this folder is picked up automatically — there is no
hand-maintained list of scripts.

## Key Concepts

- **Scientific view:** The "agent in a box" sees measurements and reasons
  about hidden generative causes.
- **Hypothesis-testing view:** Each observation is a datum; the agent updates
  belief distributions over candidate hypotheses.
- **Statistical view:** Bayes' theorem in its elementary form — prior ×
  likelihood ∝ posterior.
- **Inverse problem:** When the generative function is non-injective, the
  posterior can be genuinely multi-modal even from a unimodal prior.
